# PROJECT_RULES — Parabula (Single Source of Truth)

This repository is a **self-validating, RTL-first A4 digital textbook and worksheet system**. This document is the **ground truth** for future edits and code generation.

---

## 0) Product goal (non-negotiable)

- The main purpose of the site is to **create, present, organize, and print high-quality A4 math worksheets** under uniform rules.
- The product must stay suitable for **thousands of future pages**, not only the current set.
- The system must remain **topic-first**, not a raw file dump.
- The primary reading flow is:
  - Home / entry = **topic choice first**
  - Topic screen = **only pages of that topic**
  - Actions = open, browse, select, print, PDF, share, download
- The site must work comfortably on **desktop and mobile**.
- `preview/all-pages.*` is a **secondary utility screen**, not the primary home experience.
- No AI session may add demo text, demo buttons, fake reports, fake workflows, or fake content.
- No AI session may merge or blur separate math topics. For example, **"משוואות" and "משוואות ריבועיות" must remain distinct topics unless the user explicitly instructs otherwise**.
- No pages may be deleted, merged, renamed, or reassigned between topics without explicit user approval and a rules update.

---

## 1) Ground Truth (non-negotiable)

### A4 page contract

- Every textbook page lives in repo root as `עמוד-N.html`.
- Every page MUST contain exactly one main wrapper: `main.a4-page.page-N`.
- `.a4-page` is **exactly** `210mm × 297mm`.
- DO NOT use `overflow: auto` anywhere to “fix” height.

### A4 content coverage (required)

- Pages must be laid out to **use the full A4 page area** (no large unintended empty regions), while still respecting the A4 contract above.
- **Pythagoras — topic page 1** (`עמוד-9.html`) MUST be composed to **span the entire A4 page** and utilize the available height according to the design rules of this repo.

### Topic pages must not overflow (required)

- Topic pages under `pages/**` that represent printable A4 content must also be composed so that interactive/writing elements (e.g., answer boxes) **never spill outside the A4 bounds**.
- Avoid fixed widths that can overflow in narrow columns; prefer responsive layout primitives (`min-width: 0`, flexible grid tracks, and `flex: 1` where appropriate).

### CSS rules (critical)

- **ZERO inline styles**: no `<style>` tags and no `style="..."` attributes in any `עמוד-N.html`.
- **All page-specific CSS** goes ONLY in `styles/pages/עמוד-N.css`.
- `styles/a4-base.css` is **immutable foundation** (do not edit).

### Project-wide HTML/CSS separation (required)

- The repository enforces **full separation between HTML and CSS**.
- **No inline CSS anywhere**:
  - No `<style>` blocks
  - No `style="..."` attributes
- Styling must live in dedicated CSS files (A4 pages under `styles/`, topic pages under their topic `style.css`).

### RTL rules

- RTL (`dir="rtl"`) must be preserved across layout and navigation.
- If you must use LTR for math/answers, do it via CSS (`direction: ltr; unicode-bidi: isolate;`) in the page CSS.

### Math rendering

- Use MathJax delimiters:
  - Inline: `\( ... \)`
  - Display: `$$ ... $$`
- **Do not use `$...$`** or any `$` math delimiter in pages.

### Math notation (answers)

- When a problem has **two solutions** (e.g., quadratic roots), label them as **subscripts** using MathJax: `\(x_1\)` and `\(x_2\)` (not `x1/x2` text).

### Hebrew math writing (required)

- In Hebrew text, write negative numbers in a **mathematically correct order**: “מינוס 4” (or `\(-4\)`), not “4 מינוס”.

### Subquestion formatting (required)

- Subquestions inside a page (e.g., `.q-sub`) are separated by the **black bullet** only.
- Do **not** add manual numbering markers inside the text (no `א./ב./ג.` and no `1/2/3`) unless the user explicitly requested numbered subquestions for that page.

### Solution / writing space (required)

- Pages that include free-writing areas (e.g., `.solution-space`) must be laid out so those areas **expand to use the available A4 height**, avoiding large unintended blank regions.

### Exercise blocks must be separated (required)

- In exercise grids/lists (e.g., `.pyt-tri-grid` with `.problem-block`), each block must be visually separated with **white space between blocks**.
- Blocks must not touch each other; do not set vertical gaps to zero in a way that merges adjacent blocks.

### Solutions footer (layout + notation)

- When a page includes a compact solutions footer (e.g., `.eq-solutions`, `.pyt-solutions`), the answers must be **distributed across the full line width** (e.g., via CSS grid), not clumped to one side.
- For exercises whose answers are a **pair** (e.g., two roots), present the pair with **correct parentheses**: `\((x_1,\,x_2)\)` or `\((a,\,b)\)` as appropriate.

### SVG rules

- Every SVG stroke must be **non-scaling**:
  - Use `vector-effect: non-scaling-stroke` (in SVG attributes or via page CSS selectors).

### Geometry diagrams — parallelism notation (required)

- **Placement:** Parallel markers MUST be placed at the **exact midpoint** of the segment they annotate.
- **Style:** Markers must be **clean, sharp chevrons** centered on the segment (avoid cluttered marks that can read as right-angle/angle notation).
- **Distinct pairs:** Use a **single chevron** (`>`) for the first parallel pair and a **double chevron** (`>>`) for the second parallel pair.
- **Alignment:** The chevrons must be rotated to match the **segment direction/slope**.
- **Labels:** Vertex labels (A, B, C, D) must sit **outside** the polygon with a consistent padding (~5pt) and must not touch/overlap any stroke.
- **Print clarity:** Use consistent, high-contrast strokes suitable for A4 printing (no faint gray lines for primary geometry edges).

### Geometry / coordinate systems

- Coordinate system container size: **440px × 440px**.
- Grid increment: **22px** (20 units per axis).
- Labels use `.axis-label` with **absolute positioning** relative to `.coordinate-system`.

---

## 2) Live Preview (permanent)

### The canonical preview server

- Run: `npm run preview`
- URL: http://127.0.0.1:5179
- Reader UI: `/preview` (also served at `/`)

Reader URL parameters (supported):

- `mode=all` (default) or `mode=book`
- `file=<relative html path>` (must exist in the Preview TOC; otherwise the reader falls back to the first valid page)

Notes:

- Default host/port are controlled by env vars `HOST` and `PORT` (see `preview/server.mjs`).
- Windows helper: `./preview.ps1` (can also run with `-Lan` to bind `0.0.0.0`).

### Live reload + correctness signals

- The preview must reload on changes to watched files (recursive): `*.html`, `*.css`, `*.js`, `*.mjs`, `*.svg` (excluding ignored paths like `.git/`, `node_modules/`, `.vscode/`).
- The preview must **detect A4 overflow** for `.a4-page` and report a terminal line:
  - Prefix: `[CRITICAL ERROR]`
  - Format: `A4 overflow: <file> (...)` including measured scroll/client sizes.

### /preview Reader UI (navigation must stay visible)

- In `/preview`, the Reader’s top controls (mode toggle, prev/next, and topic buttons) must remain **visible while scrolling**.
- In `/preview`, the Reader must show an **accurate A4 print boundary frame** for every page at all times (in all modes), so layout decisions are made against real print bounds.

---

## 3) Navigation engine (textbook hierarchy)

### System files must never appear in the Preview TOC (required)

- System/deployment files (Redirects, 404, Rules) must never appear in the `/preview` TOC or topic buttons.

### Topic buttons must always lead to the first page (required)

- Clicking a topic button must always navigate to the **first page** in that topic sequence (topic-local page 1), not to a previously selected or cached page.

Each page MUST contain a `.preview-nav` with:

- `.nav-meta` formatted as: `{Topic} — עמוד {i} / {total}`
- `.page-number` must equal `{i}` (topic-local index, not global file number).
- Topic bar `.preview-nav-topics` must:
  - Use `.topic-link`
  - Mark the current topic link with `.is-active`
  - Include `aria-current="page"` on the active link.

Prev/Next links must match the repo’s global reading order as defined by topics and per-topic page indices.

### Product navigation requirement

- The primary home experience must present **topics first**. `preview/app.html` now serves as a redirect entry into `preview/topics.html` rather than a standalone hub.
- The primary topic experience must present **pages of the chosen topic only**.
- `preview/all-pages.*` may exist as a utility surface, but it must not replace the topic-first home experience.

---

## 3.1) Page numbering UI (design uniformity)

### Root A4 pages (`עמוד-N.html`)

- The page index UI is the circular badge `.page-number` in the header.
- Its **visual design must remain uniform across the entire project**.
- Do not override `.page-number` styling in page CSS (`styles/pages/עמוד-N.css`).
- Do not override `.header-container` in page CSS (`styles/pages/עמוד-N.css`) — keep header placement uniform.
- Prefer fixing layout issues by adjusting the content area, not by moving/hiding/re-styling the page number.

### Topic pages (`pages/**`)

- The topic page index UI is the circular badge `.page-badge`.
- Its **visual design must remain uniform across the entire project** (match the canonical A4 header badge look).
- The badge color must use `var(--title-blue)` (not per-topic accent colors).
- The number inside `.page-badge` MUST match the page index `X` from the path `pages/<topic>/עמוד-X/index.html`.
- The badge must be styled only in the canonical topic stylesheet `pages/<topic>/style.css`.
- Do not create or link per-page topic stylesheets like `pages/<topic>/עמוד-X/style.css`.

---

## 4) Automated testing loop

### One-command validation

- `npm test` must be green.

### Watch mode (required in development)

- Run: `npm run test:watch:page`
- This must re-run the relevant page test on every save of:
  - `עמוד-*.html`
  - `styles/pages/*.css`
  - `preview/*`

### Access layer validation (required)

- Run: `npm run validate:access`
- This must validate the currently committed access layer.
- It must verify what is actually present on `main`, not planned files that do not yet exist.

### Preview overlap audit (required when changing access surfaces)

- When working on preview/mobile/topic/print overlap questions, use `node scripts/audit-preview-overlaps.mjs` directly.
- Do not document `npm run audit:preview` unless that script is actually present in `package.json`.

---

## 5) Failure recovery protocol

1. Read the terminal error from `npm test`.
2. Locate the matching rule section in this file.
3. Fix source HTML/CSS (do **not** modify tests to “make it pass”).
4. If preview live-reload drops, restart `npm run preview`.

---

## 6) Progress reporting (required)

When executing multi-step work (especially via Copilot/automation), **every step update** must include an explicit remaining-work percentage using this exact format:

- `נותרו X% לסיום.`

Rules:

- `X` is an integer `0`–`100`.
- `X` must decrease as progress is made.
- Use `0%` only when the task is fully complete.

---

## 7) Golden Preview Standard (required)

- Preview background must be a **solid** neutral color; patterns/gradients/images are strictly forbidden outside the A4 boundary.
- Preview pages must be **top-aligned** in the reading area (no vertical centering that starts mid-page).
- In “all pages” mode, pages must appear as a **single vertical sequence** with stable spacing.

### Zero Tolerance — Non-centered preview pages

- The A4 preview must be **horizontally centered at all times** in `/preview` (all modes).
- Any drift/bias to the right (common under RTL) is a **critical regression**.
- The preview _layout container_ may be forced to `direction: ltr` to guarantee centering, but the `.a4-page` content must remain RTL.
- The `.a4-page` must never be allowed to shrink in flex layouts (`flex-shrink: 0`) and must keep a stable outer margin in the host.

---

## 8) Preview Stability Contract (required)

- `/preview` must never show a blank main reading area when valid TOC entries exist.
- If a stored/selected file becomes invalid, the reader must clear the broken state and fall back to the first valid page.
- The reader must show a visible loading state while the preview page is being resolved.
- If primary rendering fails, the reader must display a fallback iframe for a valid page instead of leaving an empty gray area.
- A blank preview shell with a loaded sidebar is considered a critical regression.

Additional stability requirements:

- The reader must start at the **top of the selected page** (not mid-scroll).
- Book mode must not render an “empty slot” state.

---

## 9) Shared cleanup permission (design only)

- Design-only shared cleanup is allowed for a page family such as equations when no learning content is changed.
- The cleanup may remove stale styling, inconsistent title styling, inconsistent spacing, and legacy visual residue.
- The no-inline-style rule applies to preview utility pages as well.
- Mobile entry files under preview are an official part of the live system.

## 10) Equations family cleanup

- Pages belonging to the non-quadratic equations family may receive **design-only shared cleanup**.
- This cleanup must not change the learning text.
- It may normalize fonts, title presentation, spacing, visual residue from older styling, and SVG text styling.
- Quadratic-equation pages are excluded unless explicitly requested.

## 11) Metadata reality contract

- `meta/topics.json` is present and remains the canonical source metadata for worksheet content structure.
- Topic separation inside metadata must remain explicit and stable.
- Distinct topics must not be collapsed merely because their names are similar.

## 12) Live access system map (actual current main branch)

### Canonical content layer
- `עמוד-N.html`
- `styles/pages/עמוד-N.css`
- `styles/a4-base.css`

### Metadata layer
- `meta/topics.json`

### Access/UI layer currently present on `main`
- `preview/index.html`
- `preview/app.html` (topic-first redirect entry to `preview/topics.html`)
- `preview/topics.html`
- `preview/print.html`
- `preview/all-pages.html`
- `preview/all-pages.css`
- `preview/all-pages.js`
- `mobile-app.html`
- `mobile-app-install.html`

### State/handoff layer currently present on `main`
- `STATE/LIVE_STATUS.md`
- `STATE/ARCHITECTURE_MAP.md`
- `STATE/PROJECT_CONTINUITY.md`

This map is intentionally limited to files that are actually present on `main`.

## 13) Topics browser contract

- `preview/topics.html` is the dedicated topic-first browsing surface that exists on `main`.
- It must expose clear topic buttons/cards, comfortable navigation, and topic-local page browsing.
- It must remain suitable for phone usage.
- Topic-first UX is the primary UX of the product.

## 14) All-pages utility contract

- `preview/all-pages.*` is live on `main`.
- It is a secondary utility surface for searching, filtering, selecting, sharing, downloading, and printing across all pages.
- It must not replace topic-first home flow.
- It must open live page links correctly under GitHub Pages.

## 15) Mobile live entry contract

- The primary mobile app is `mobile-app.html`.
- The primary install page is `mobile-app-install.html`.
- The dedicated manifest is `mobile-app.webmanifest`.
- `preview/icon.svg` is part of the official live mobile path.
- The mobile app must always reflect the current worksheet repository through repository metadata.
- Legacy mobile entry files may exist, but the dedicated mobile app is the primary path.
- `preview/phone.*` is a utility / legacy layer and must not be treated as the canonical mobile runtime.

## 16) Preview UX polish contract

- `preview/app.html`, `preview/phone.html`, `preview/install.html`, `preview/print.html`, `preview/topics.html`, and `preview/all-pages.html` must keep a unified visual language.
- Shared visual polish belongs in shared preview CSS, not inline style blocks.
- UX polish may improve spacing, button clarity, focus states, mobile tap comfort, and visual consistency without changing worksheet content.

## 17) Dedicated mobile worksheet app

- The dedicated mobile worksheet app must remain easy to edit.
- Keep separate HTML / CSS / JS files.
- Use repository metadata as the source of truth for topics and worksheet pages.
- The mobile app must provide topic browsing, fast page navigation, live preview, open, print, and PDF handoff.
- The mobile app PDF action must hand off into `preview/print.html` for preview-before-print, not skip directly to a raw worksheet page.
- The canonical mobile reader should resolve worksheet pages against the current repository origin so local preview and published runtime both stay usable and same-origin.
- New mobile fixes must land in `mobile-app.*` first, not in `preview/phone.*`.

## 18) Planned but not yet live on `main`

- The following surfaces were discussed or partially prototyped during AI planning, but must not be treated as live on `main` unless committed and present:
  - `meta/all-pages-index.json`
  - `preview/booklet.*`
  - `preview/flow-shell.*`
  - `STATE/SAFE_IMPROVEMENT_REPORT.md`
- Another AI must not assume these files exist just because they appeared in earlier planning or chat output.

## 19) Mobile app navigation contract

- The mobile app must support fast movement like a digital book on the phone.
- The user must be able to move to the next page, next topic, and the first page of the current topic.
- Prev/Next in the mobile app should follow the global book order across topics, while topic entry still opens the first page of the selected topic.
- The mobile app should expose direct actions for install flow and PDF/print flow.
- The mobile app should keep the topic chip strip usable on a real phone, even when topic names are long.
- The mobile reader should expose explicit reader modes when needed, including a full-page mode (`עמוד מלא`) and an enlarged-reading mode (`קריאה מוגדלת`).
- When the mobile reader enlarges a page for width-first reading, it should clearly tell the user that scrolling inside the reader is expected and intentional.

## 20) Mobile app reading flow contract

- The dedicated mobile app must support quick movement to the first page of the current topic.
- The dedicated mobile app must support quick movement to the first page of the whole book.
- The dedicated mobile app should keep the selected page visible in the page list.
- The dedicated mobile app should expose a clear loading signal while switching pages.

## 21) Mobile app resume flow contract

- The mobile app should offer a clear resume-from-last-position flow.
- The mobile app should expose a clear start-from-beginning action.
- The opening state should feel like a useful reading app, not a raw technical viewer.

## 22) Mobile topic home cards contract

- The mobile app should expose clear topic home cards near the opening state.
- Topic home cards should allow fast entry into a topic from its first page.
- The opening state on mobile should emphasize useful reading navigation, not raw technical structure.

## 23) Print / PDF contract

- `preview/print.html` is the live print/PDF handoff surface currently present on `main`.
- `preview/print.js` may accept URL-driven page selection (for example from the mobile app) as long as it still previews only real worksheet pages from repository metadata.
- The print/PDF handoff should show explicit context when it was opened from the mobile app so preview-before-print feels intentional, not accidental.
- The final print / Save as PDF step may remain browser-driven.
- `preview/all-pages.*` and `preview/topics.*` may prepare selections for print/PDF, but must not bypass real print flow.

## 24) Live duplicate / legacy interpretation contract

- A duplicate or legacy-adjacent file is not automatically an error.
- `preview/print-center.js` is legacy/duplicate-adjacent relative to `preview/print.js`.
- `preview/phone.*` is legacy/compat relative to `mobile-app.*`.
- Future AI sessions must not delete these layers blindly; first map their role and inspect `scripts/audit-preview-overlaps.mjs`.

## 25) Mobile app public publish contract

- The public mobile app URL is `mobile-app.html`.
- The public install page URL is `mobile-app-install.html`.
- Published runtime topic data must come from repository runtime metadata.
- Supporting metadata such as `mobile-topics.json` must stay aligned with `meta/topics.json` and must not silently merge distinct topics.
- The public install page should stay top-aligned and useful on phone screens; avoid vertically centered layouts that create large empty gray regions below the primary install card.
- The public app must not depend on an alternate hidden worksheet source.
- The same published files should exist in both root and `/docs` so either Pages source can work.

## 26) Open-work policy for future AI sessions

- Preserve the canonical worksheet source first.
- Prefer improvements above the pages, not inside the pages.
- When planning new work, document what already exists before adding new surfaces.
- If a requested change touches preview/mobile/topic/print flows, check the scripts and `package.json` that are actually present on `main` before calling the work complete.
- Every real change must remain consistent with this file.
- This file must reflect reality on `main`, not aspirational architecture from an earlier planning session.

## 27) Canonical mobile reader engine contract

- The dedicated mobile worksheet reader remains `mobile-app.*` and is canonical over `preview/phone.*`.
- The mobile worksheet reader currently remains **iframe-based by design**.
- The canonical worksheet source remains the root A4 pages and `styles/a4-base.css`; mobile improvements must not fork or duplicate worksheet content.
- Mobile rendering fixes must be applied in the mobile reader shell through controlled runtime presentation overrides and reader-engine logic.
- Mobile reader progress copy should remain human-readable in Hebrew (for example, `עמוד X מתוך Y בנושא`), not raw technical counters.
- Mobile reader fixes must prefer stable centering, stable scaling, and removal of desktop preview aesthetics before adding new gesture/polish features.
- Real-device finding: width-first enlargement alone is not sufficient if right-edge worksheet content can still be clipped or pushed outside the comfortable phone viewport.
- On narrow phone screens, `עמוד מלא` must keep the entire A4 width visible without unexpected right-edge clipping.
- On narrow phone screens, `קריאה מוגדלת` may enlarge the worksheet beyond viewport width only when the reader clearly explains the intentional internal pan/scroll behavior and preserves access to right-side worksheet content.

---

## 7) Shared cleanup permission (design only)

- Design-only shared cleanup is allowed for a page family such as equations when no learning content is changed.
- The no-inline-style rule applies to preview utility pages as well.
- Mobile entry files under preview are an official part of the live system.
